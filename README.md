# Size it up!

**Instructions**:

- Set the base size of page in `rem` using `:root`.
- In rem, set a font size to each paragraph element with a size for a class. Make the font size represent the size description (small, medium, large etc.).
- Set a font size for the footer. Then, adjust the font-size of the `description` class which should be **relative** to the footer.
